# MSc degree thesis: Multi-agent reinforcement learning for workload distribution in FaaS edge computing systems

This git repository contains the source code of my master thesis, written in LaTeX. The source code for the experiments is in a [**separate repository on GitHub**](https://github.com/unimib-datAI/marl-dfaas).

The thesis consists of three documents:

1. The main thesis (a double-page book for printing),
2. The summary (a five-page article),
3. The presentation (a beamer presentation).

All of these files can be [**downloaded directly**](https://gitlab.com/ema-pe/master-degree-thesis/-/releases/v1) as PDF files.

Please note that thesis and slides are written in italian.

The git repository is available online on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ema-pe/master-degree-thesis) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ema-pe/master-degree-thesis). However, GitHub is a **read-only** mirror of GitLab.
